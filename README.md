# API Weather Dashboard
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Chasek6/api-weather-dashboard)
## Description
The application is a 5-day forecast of the weather for whatever city of the user decides to pick. The Weather Dashboard will present you with current & future conditions for the city and will add previous searched cities to a user city search-list. I decided on giving the webpage a tropical color scheme to give users the feeling of vacation while scoping out possible weather for a trip.
